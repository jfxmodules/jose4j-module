https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/src/jose4j-0.9.6/src/. The code for this 
build was taken from the 0.9.6 tag from the original project.
For the initial commit one unit test needed to be changed because a message 
from an exception changed. The build is completely different. 
All changes from the oritinal source code comapred to the initial commit
